# AI & Semiconductor Blog – README

## 📖 About This Project

This is my personal AI & Semiconductor blog where I document my learning journey. I cover topics related to AI development, AI investing, semiconductors, and the intersection of these fields. The blog serves as a structured way to learn, share insights, and build an online presence around these topics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Remix** – For building a fast, scalable, and dynamic web experience.
- **Tailwind CSS** – For a clean and customizable UI.
- **Markdown** – For writing and formatting blog posts easily.
- **Hosting** – TBD (Could be Vercel, Netlify, or another platform).

## 📌 Goals

- Learn AI & semiconductor concepts by documenting key insights.
- Share whiteboard animations, blogs, and podcasts to simplify complex topics.
- Build an audience around AI & semiconductor investing and development.
- Potentially monetize through content, consulting, or other opportunities.
